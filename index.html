    <p>Tracksuits and red wine, movies for two
We'll take off our phones and we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo though I always lose
Cos you watch the TV while I'm watching you
There's not many people I'd honestly say I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
Dumb conversation, we lose track of time
Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine
We watch "The Notebook" for the 17th time
I'll say it's stupid, then you catch me crying
We're not making out on a boat in the rain or in a house I painted blue
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
So shut all the windows and lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one, don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
You could be dancing on table tops wearing high heels
Drinking until the world spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment has so much appeal
Who needs stars, we've got a roof
And there's nothing like doing nothing with you
No, there's nothing like doing nothing with you

Tracksuits and red wine, movies for two
We'll take off our phones and we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo though I always lose
Cos you watch the TV while I'm watching you
There's not many people I'd honestly say I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
Dumb conversation, we lose track of time
Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine
We watch "The Notebook" for the 17th time
I'll say it's stupid, then you catch me crying
We're not making out on a boat in the rain or in a house I painted blue
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
So shut all the windows and lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one, don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
You could be dancing on table tops wearing high heels
Drinking until the world spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment has so much appeal
Who needs stars, we've got a roof
And there's nothing like doing nothing with you
No, there's nothing like doing nothing with you

We're not making out on a boat in the rain or in a house I painted blue
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
So shut all the windows and lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one, don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
You could be dancing on table tops wearing high heels
Drinking until the world spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment has so much appeal
Who needs stars, we've got a roof
And there's nothing like doing nothing with you
No, there's nothing like doing nothing with you
Tracksuits and red wine, movies for two
We'll take off our phones and we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo though I always lose
Cos you watch the TV while I'm watching you
There's not many people I'd honestly say I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you
Dumb conversation, we lose track of time
Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine
We watch "The Notebook" for the 17th time
I'll say it's stupid, then you catch me crying
