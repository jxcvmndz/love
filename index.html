    <p>You say there's so much you don't know
      You need to go and find yourself
      You say you'd rather be alone
      'Cause you think you won't find it tied to someone else
      Ooh, who said it's true
      That the growing only happens on your own?
      They don't know me and you
      I don't think you have to leave
      If to change is what you need
      You can change right next to me
      When you're high, I'll take the lows
      You can ebb and I can flow
      And we'll take it slow
      And grow as we go
      Grow as we go
      You won't be the only one
      I am unfinished, I've got so much left to learn
      I don't know how this river runs
      But I'd like the company through every twist and turn
      Ooh, who said it's true
      That the growing only happens on your own?
      They don't know me and you
      You don't ever have to leave
      If to change is what you need
      You can change right next to me
      When you're high, I'll take the lows
      You can ebb and I can flow

      I can't promise it's not written in the stars
      But I believe that when it's done
      We're gonna see that it was better
      That we grew up together
      Tell me you don't wanna leave

Tell me you don't wanna leave
'Cause if change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high, I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow

Grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go

You can ebb and I can flow
We'll take it slow
And grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go
You say there's so much you don't know
You need to go and find yourself
You say you'd rather be alone
'Cause you think you won't find it tied to someone else
Ooh, who said it's true
That the growing only happens on your own?
They don't know me and you
I don't think you have to leave
If to change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high, I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow

I don't know how this river runs
But I'd like the company through every twist and turn
Ooh, who said it's true
That the growing only happens on your own?
They don't know me and you
You don't ever have to leave
If to change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high, I'll take the lows
You can ebb and I can flow

And grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go
Grow as we go
I don't know who we'll become
I can't promise it's not written in the stars
But I believe that when it's done
We're gonna see that it was better
That we grew up together
Tell me you don't wanna leave
'Cause if change is what you need
You can change right next to me
When you're high, I'll take the lows
